    <h3>Reduce Method ES6</h3>
    <p>
       i- The reduce() method executes a reducer function for array element. <br>

ii-  The reduce() method returns a single value: the function's accumulated result. <br>

The reduce() method does not execute the function for empty array elements. <br>

The reduce() method does not change the original array. <br>
    </p>
    <h2>Syntax:-</h2>
    <h3>array.reduce(function(total, currentValue, currentIndex, arr), initialValue)</h3>
 
    <!-- Project by reduce method  -->
     <h1>Project By array.reduce method.</h1>
    <h2>I am gonna create an array of Objects called Primary  Colors</h2>
 <h3>Next project for Interviewer</h3>
 <p>We know that we want a function that takes a string and returns a boolean of some kind of boolean basically says like is this expression balanced or not.</p>
 <h2>How the code work</h2>
 <p>
    1. The input string is split into an array of characters.
    2. The reduce() method is applied to the array, starting with an initial value of 0.
    3. For each character, the callback function increments or decrements the previous value based on whether it's an opening or closing parenthesis.
    4. If the final previous value is 0, the parentheses are balanced, and the function returns true (due to the negation !).
    5. If the final previous value is not 0, the parentheses are unbalanced, and the function returns false.
    
    In the first example, "(((", the previous value becomes 3 (incremented three times), so the function returns false.
    
    In the second example, ")(", the previous value becomes -1 (incremented once and then decremented once), so the function returns false.</p>

  <h1>  Sum of values in an object array (reduce Method) </h1>
To sum up the values contained in an array of objects, you must supply an initialValue, so that each item passes through your function.
